         <p class = 'first'>The very first thing that is needed to be done before starting any project is to know your team members. That is exactly what we did. After Dr.Yusubov assigned every student to a team, Tural directly emailed all of us in order to get our phone numbers for faster communication. After that, we have created our WhatsApp group and started chatting actively in order to learn about each other and plan what we are going to do with the project. Besides chatting, we started organizing Zoom calls and meetings on campus once-twice a week. All of this communication was done in order to work properly together, and fortunately, to be able to build a very eye-pleasant project.</p>

        <img src="brainstorming.png" class = 'brainstorming'>
        <p class = 'second'>The brainstorming part is a very important part of the project for us. The first thing for proper brainstorming is to get everyone together, or at least to gather as many people as possible. First, each of us wrote in the group about the free time that he has on each of the days. Then we found several options for free time and voted for the most convenient and right for us. After that, each of us, even before our meeting, collected interesting information, suggestions, and so on. It was very important for us to listen to the opinion of each member of the group. Thus, each of us began to have a lot of interesting ideas and suggestions. We considered each proposal together and accepted the best of them.</p>

        <img src="decision.png" class = 'decision'>
        <p class = 'third'>After a very long discussion and brainstorming, we started to negotiate with schools in order to hold our event at one of those. Unfortunately, most of them declined our request. We did not give up and continued to go to schools and try to persuade them to accept us. However, nothing worked… On of the days, true magic happened. At one of the schools where none of us studied before, we were very welcomed and the school administration easily accepted our request. It was Secondary school No167. We are planning to hold our event on 6-12 December, and we believe we will make kids love computer science.</p>
