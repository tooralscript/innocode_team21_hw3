		<p class = 'Ehtiram'>My name is Ehtiram Maharramli. I am 18 years old. I was born in Baku, but I am from Jabrayil. I got accepted to ADA University in 2020 with 606.2 score(DİM). My major is Information Technology. I was always interested in programming and it was the main reason for choosing this major. My hobbies are playing and watching football, playing chess, listening to music, learning coding. I believe I will be one of the best specialists in my major.

		<p class = 'Ramil'>My name is Ramil Hagverdiyev. For the last 2 years I have been preparing for the SAT exam. After I successfully passed it, I have applied to several universities in Turkey as well as ADA University. My final decision was ADA University. My major is Computer Science, and I think that I was not mistaken while making that choice, since I was always interested in how computes work. My hobbies are football, tennis and movies.

		<p class = 'Sharif'>Hello! My name is Sharif Sharifli. I am 16 years old. I was born in Baku and have been living there ever since. I study in the ADA University and I have entered there through the ADA school thanks to my performance, which did not require any external exams. The Major I chose is Computer Engineering. I have had interest in technology ever since I was little. Though I chose engineering because in the last couple of years I have had more interest in hardware side of things rather than software. I think that is more fun. My hobbies are making/listening to music, watching Formula 1, learning about technology and news regrading them, and gaming. I really hope this path will give me a fun life in the future!

		<p class = 'Tural'>Hey there! I am Tural from Innocode. I am 17 years old, and I am currently doing my major in IT at ADA University. Being natively from Shusha, I was born and raised in Baku. After preparing for and getting my SAT & IELTS certificates, I applied to ADA University, and hopefully, got accepted. Being very interested in my studies, I feel very happy for making the right choice while choosing the major. Although we study a lot of related things, I find coding the most interesting subject in my entire academic journey.
